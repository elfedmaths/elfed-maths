                    <h3>The counting game</h3>
                    <p>The challenge is to count together as a class. Everybody is stood on their feet and somebody will start the 
                        game by saying one, somebody else then says two, a different person says three, and so on. Each student can only 
                        say one number and you can't go in a specific order or point to the next person. If two students say a number 
                        at the same time, then you must start again from zero.</p>
                    <p><span>Support: </span>students could sit down after they say their number.</p>
                    <p><span>Challenge: </span>students count up in multiples of 2 or 3.</p>

                    <p>Students count to 10 together as a class.</p>
                    <p><i>Stage 1: </i>every time you say a multiple of 2, you put your right arm in the air.</p>
                    <p><i>Stage 2: </i>every time you say a multiple of 3, you put your left arm in the air. 
                        (Watch out for number 6!)</p>
                    <p><i>Stage 3: </i>every time you say a multiple of 5, you turn around.</p>
                    <p>By this stage, every number should have an action, apart from 1 and 7.</p>
                    <p><span>Support: </span>Complete each stage individually before doing them together.</p>

                    <p>Students can say up to three numbers, starting with one. The first student starts 
                        and says either 1, or 1,2 or 1,2,3. The next student then continues counting, 
                        saying up to three numbers. The student who then says 21 is out of the game, and 
                        the next student in line then starts again from 1. The last student remaining is the winner.</p>

                        They should be yes or no questions, where students are narrowing down what the chosen 
                        number is between. For example: is it odd? Is it less than 50? Is it greater than 30? And so onâ€¦</p>

                        of their book. You then ask a maths question, where the answer is the bingo number called. 
                        For example, 3x2 would mean 6 is ticked off. Play for a full house.</p>
