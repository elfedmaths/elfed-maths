                <h2>Practice</h2>
                <p>Select the topic(s) you would like to practise or be tested on, and then hit start. Press Next for more questions, and Stop to show your answers. This feature will allow you to practice a range of topics at your own pace and is an excellent resource to use with mini white boards. With the Challenge feature, you need to type the correct answer into the answer box and hit enter, and the next question will then appear if your answer is correct. You have the option to select your music, set your timer or start your stopwatch. At the end of the timer, you will be given a score for the number of Challenge questions you answered correctly. See what your personal high score could be!</p>
                <h2>Learn</h2>
                <p>Watch short videos explaining how to do key topics.</p>
                <h2>Activities</h2>
                <p>There are 8 Maths games that you can play with your classes in any of your subjects! They are a great way to incorporate number work into your lessons, and each activity has a Support and Challenge feature, allowing for easy differentiation. The stopwatch allows for great competition too!! Your students will love these, and will be asking you to play their favourites each week.</p>
                <h2>Classroom</h2>
                <p>There are 8 different sets of questions that you can use with your classes, focusing on a combination of different number and algebra skills, which are progressively more challenging from Set A up to Set H. Each set of questions can be refreshed, so no two tasks are ever the same, and the correct answers are instantly available for each task. The Gwaith Dosbarth and dates are changeable, by clicking on them, to support with your classroom routines. The four sets of Numeracy questions are to support students who are sitting their WJEC Numeracy GCSE exam this summer.</p>
                <h2>Literacy</h2>
                <p>There are five different areas of Mathematics, as well as a random option, which could be any word from the categories. The word appears on the board along with the accompanying Welsh translation.</p>
                <p>Oracy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Describe: A student stands at the front of the classroom, with their back to the board. Without actually saying the specific word, the rest of the class then describe the word on the board for the student to guess. See who can guess the most correct answers in their 60 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Define: Select a word at random for students to define in their books, along with an example and a non-example. Students should then feedback to the group, sharing interesting examples and non-examples that they think other students won\'t have thought of.</li>
                    <li>Develop: Students are to use the key word in a sentence and write it in their books. Students should then swap books to peer assess for literacy and check the sentence is also mathematically correct, before swapping back and sharing their sentences with the group.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Wordle</h2>
                <p>A great way to revise key vocabulary and encourage student participation. You can refresh for new words, or easily create your own in the bottom right hand corner.</p>
                <h2>Worksheets</h2>
                <p>These are printable worksheets that support Data topics for the new CfW, with cross cutting themes supporting:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diversity</li>
                    <li>RSE</li>
                    <li>Careers and Work-Related Experiences</li>
                    <li>Local, National and International Contexts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The worksheets are differentiated, which will support with mixed ability classes. Watching the relevant Learn video first would support students in completing the graphs, and then pausing the video at the appropriate point would allow the students to self and peer mark their work, following the success criteria from the question on the board. The data on each question will be refreshed each time, so no two worksheets are the same, meaning the resources can be used multiple times.</p>
                <h2>Timestables</h2>
                <p>A quick tool to practice timestables. Select one or more timestables to practice, Answer questions against the clock, or against the counter. Easy to use a great source of competition.</p>
                <h2>Games</h2>
                <p>A collection of games created for elfedmaths.co.uk that promote a love of Maths through class games re-imagined.</p>
                <h2>Revision</h2>
